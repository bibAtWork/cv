    "summary": "I'm a passionate Tech Lead specializing in Cloud Computing, Data Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Legacy Modernization. With a strong focus on delivering reliable and value-centric solutions, I thrive in an environment where quality and continuous improvement are paramount.\n\nI embody a hands-on mentality, leading by example to inspire and motivate my team. My experience in agile team development enables me to guide cross-functional groups towards success, fostering collaboration, and delivering reliable results.\n\nI have a deep understanding of Cloud Computing, leveraging its vast potential to architect secure and scalable systems. I stay at the forefront of emerging technologies and industry trends, proactively identifying and mitigating potential cybersecurity risks to safeguard critical data assets.\n\nBeyond my technical expertise, I am dedicated to social engagement and giving back to the community. I actively contribute to open-source projects and love to share knowledge (tech talks, mentoring, lectureships at universities, etc.), as well as collaborating with like-minded professionals to drive innovation and foster collective growth.\n\nHere are some key highlights of my background:\n\n• Proven track record as a Tech Lead, successfully delivering complex projects and business objectives.\n• Extensive experience in cloud-based solutions, especially in designing and executing multi-cloud and edge-computing strategies with Kubernetes.\n• Deep knowledge of cybersecurity principles, implementing robust measures during the software development process and in the cloud to protect sensitive information.\n• Proficient in data engineering, utilizing distributed data processing (Apache Spark, Kafka) to extract valuable insights and drive informed decision-making.\n• Specialized in the topic of application modernization from COBOL/Mainframe to Java/Cloud.\n• Audience-centered communication skills to include stakeholders (developers, business experts, C-level, and external customers) in decision-making processes.\n• A leader, fostering a culture of innovation, collaboration, and growth within cross-functional teams.\n\nTo sum it up, I am the bridge between management, stakeholders, and the engine room. With my in-depth technical and leadership expertise, I navigate through the complexity of a VUCA-driven landscape, constantly maintaining an overview. By building and involving cross-functional teams, I turn my knowledge into reliable and value-creating solutions, starting from day one.\n\nLet's connect and explore ways we can work together.",

He analyses together with the team members the best solution for them and for the project.\n- he has a lot of patience\n- he has a respectful attitude towards all team members\n- he creates a favourable climate for the team to develop professionally and not to be afraid to ask questions or to say, \"I don't know\".\n- he blocks the pressure from the client and other aspects / discussions which are not productive and should not be felt / reach by the team.\n- he asks the team to make some decisions\n- he discusses the real things for improvement to retrospective in a professional way\n- he always comes with things to be improved and this helps to grow up the team"
