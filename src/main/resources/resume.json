    "summary": "My career in IT started at the age of 18, when I helped out in my father's company supporting the development of a remote test automation tool, later known as cloud-based ECU testing. Since then, I have worked in different roles as Developer, Architect, and Chapter Lead, have gained knowledge in Cloud Computing, Data Analytics, Cybersecurity, and Legacy Modernization, and have worked as a freelancer while completing my master's degree in business informatics.\nIn my past 6 years at T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom) my professional focus shifted from code and tools to customers and their business challenges. Focusing on designing solution architectures for data-intensive applications.\n\nKey capabilities:\n• Building data-driven, cloud-native architectures (Spark, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP)\n• Delivering software with fast time-to-market and regulatory compliance (e.g. GDPR, ISO 27001, BSI IT-Grundschutz)\n• Leading multi-national teams (up to 30 people, €5.7M revenue)\n• Communicating to versatile stakeholders—from engineering to C-level\n• Driving Go-to-Market strategy and technical pre-sales",
